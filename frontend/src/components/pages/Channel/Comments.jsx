People are incredibly social and depend on socialization for their mental health and physical health.  This pack mentality has been ingrained into our species which leads us to do things that do not necessarily benefit ourselves the most, but rather benefit our neighbor.  This act of selflessness is what has given humanity such great success.  In the case of the Plug virus, the ethical choice of whether to get the antidote or not is clear when viewed through the history of mankind and through more modern ethical frameworks.  Getting the antidote is a selfless act that not only benefits oneâ€™s neighbor, but also protects the recipient as well.
